There are two competing tracks in my mind. There is the rational, and the irrational.

This here is the manifestation of the two trying to meld into one, single, genuine self, both at ease with the shackles and freedoms of being born to the experiences I've been born to - consequence of the decisions I've made given the parameters of my mind, body, environment, chance, and figurative spirit - as well as the peace that comes from the staring deep into the void of existence, the fork in the eternal road of nothing I do will really matter and potentially what I do could ring far into the future. 

These thoughts - they will swirl and stew, and manifest clearly I hope after many edits and revisions, considerations and reconsiderations, time lost never to return, and time invested into a future that would have otherwise never existed. 

I am here to look at things that matter and things that don't. To appreciate through a variety of different Elevations because one cannot truly see all that there is from a single vantage point. I'll also do my best not to use "one" to refer to some one, most probably an indirect way to refer to myself, and the thoughts I assume people share, but likely know that they don't. 

Behavior. Truth. Beautiful Fiction. World. Universe. This moment. And this moment. 

Here we go.
